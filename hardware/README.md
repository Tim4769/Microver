# Hardware Index

Use this index to avoid opening stale revisions by accident.

## Start here
- `current/README.md` - Latest board revisions (active work only).

## Historical revisions
- `archive/README.md` - Archived revisions and legacy boards.

## Important after folder moves
- KiCad output paths in project files may still point to old folder locations.
- After moving a board revision, update KiCad plot and export paths (Gerber, drill, BOM, CPL) before regenerating manufacturing outputs.
