# Hardware Index

Use this index to avoid opening stale revisions by accident.

## Start here
- `current/README.md` - Active board entry points (latest revision by board function).

## Historical revisions
- `archive/README.md` - Archived revisions and legacy boards.

## Canonical data locations
- KiCad projects, Gerbers, BOMs, and CPL files remain in their original revision folders (for tool-path stability).
- The `current/` and `archive/` directories are navigation indexes that point to those canonical folders.
