# Hardware Archive

Archived revisions are kept for traceability, historical test data, and rollback reference.

## Archived board folders
- `boost_manufacturing_rev_a/`
- `protection_board_manufacturing_rev_a/`
- `pcb_manufacturing_rev_a/`
- `pcb_manufacturing_rev_b/`
- `pcb_manufacturing_v1/`

## Notes
- Do not use archived revisions for new builds unless a project explicitly requires them.
- For active work, start from `../current/README.md`.
