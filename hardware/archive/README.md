# Hardware Archive

Archived revisions are kept for traceability, historical test data, and rollback reference.

## Board history indexes
- `protection_board/README.md`
- `boost_converter/README.md`
- `main_pcb/README.md`

## Notes
- Do not use archived revisions for new builds unless a project explicitly requires them.
- For active work, start from `../current/README.md`.
