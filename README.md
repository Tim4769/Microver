# Microver

Microver is a hardware/firmware project with PCB manufacturing outputs, Arduino/Raspberry Pi code, and brand assets. This repo is organized so current work lives in the 2025 folder and older experiments live in the archive.

## Repository layout

- `Code 2025/` - Current Arduino code and notes for the 2025 build.
- `Code 2025/knowledge base/` - Datasheets and build notes for drivers, lidar, and PCB work.
- `Microver PCB manufactor v1/` - Gerber and drill files for the v1 board.
- `Microver manufacture Rev B/` - Gerber and drill files for Rev B.
- `code archive-2024/` - Older Arduino/Raspberry Pi code and documentation.
- `Microver logo files/` and `Microver old logo files/` - Current and legacy logo assets.

## Getting started

1. If you are fabricating a board, use the Gerber and drill files in the appropriate manufacturing folder.
2. If you are working on firmware, start in `Code 2025/` and review the notes in `Code 2025/knowledge base/` for required hardware and driver details.
3. For older experiments and reference code, check `code archive-2024/`.

## Notes

- Manufacturing outputs are provided as Gerber and drill files (ready to upload to most PCB fabs).
- Documentation and component notes are included alongside the firmware.
